import { worker, pool } from 'digital-workers'

const reviewWorker = worker({
  name: 'document-reviewer',
  capabilities: [reviewDocument, extractData],
  concurrency: 5,
})

const workerPool = pool({
  workers: [reviewWorker, summaryWorker],
  scaling: { min: 1, max: 10 },
})

await workerPool.start()
```

## Features
