# Agentic Functions

Multi-step operations that use tools and loop until complete.

## Functions

| Function | Output | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `do` | unknown | `do\`analyze this article\`` |
| `research` | Research | `research\`market trends 2025\`` |
| `read` | string | `read\`${url}\`` |
| `browse` | Page | `browse\`${url}\`` |

## Characteristics

- **Multi-step** - Plans and executes multiple actions
- **Tool-using** - Can call other AI functions
- **Stateful** - Maintains context across steps
- **External** - Can interact with web, APIs

## Examples

```typescript
import { do as act, research, browse } from 'ai-functions'

// do - single-pass task with tools
const analysis = await act`
  analyze this article and give me
  summary, key people, and action items
  ${article}
`

// research - agentic web research
const findings = await research`AI market trends 2025`
// { summary, sources, findings, confidence }

// browse - browser automation
const page = await browse`https://competitor.com/pricing`
const pricing = await page.extract`all plan names and prices`
await page.do`click on Enterprise plan`
```

## do vs Agents

| Feature | `do` | Full Agent |
|---------|------|------------|
| Steps | Single pass | Loops until done |
| Planning | Pick tools once | Re-evaluates |
| Complexity | Simple tasks | Complex goals |

Think of `do` as one step of what an agent would do.
