# Streaming

Functions that return lists support async iteration for streaming.

## Basic Streaming

```typescript
import { list, extract } from 'ai-functions'

// Process items as generated
for await (const idea of list`startup ideas for ${industry}`) {
  console.log(idea)
}

// Early termination
for await (const idea of list`startup ideas`) {
  const valid = await is`${idea} viable?`
  if (valid) {
    console.log('Found one:', idea)
    break  // Stop generating
  }
}
```

## Streaming Functions

| Function | Streams |
|----------|---------|
| `list` | Individual items |
| `extract` | Extracted entities |

## Nested Streaming

```typescript
for await (const market of list`10 market segments for ${idea}`) {
  const research = await research`${market} market size`

  for await (const icp of list`customer profiles for ${{ idea, market }}`) {
    const brand = await ai.storyBrand({ idea, market, icp })
    const page = await code`landing page for ${{ brand }}`

    for await (const competitor of extract`companies from ${research}`) {
      const comparison = await research`${idea} vs ${competitor}`
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

- **Memory efficient** - Don't load all items at once
- **Early termination** - Stop when you find what you need
- **Progressive processing** - Start working before complete
- **Pipeline building** - Chain operations naturally
