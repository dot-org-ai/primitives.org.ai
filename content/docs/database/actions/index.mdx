# Actions

Actions provide durable execution for long-running operations. They survive restarts, track progress, and support retries.

## Why Actions?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Generate 1000 posts | Run in background, track progress |
| Embed all content | Resume from checkpoint on restart |
| Process failed jobs | Automatic retries with backoff |
| Monitor progress | Real-time status updates |

## Quick Example

```typescript
// Start background generation
const action = await db.generate({
  type: 'Post',
  count: 100,
  data: { topic: 'AI trends' },
  mode: 'background',
})
// { id: 'action_abc', status: 'pending' }

// Check progress
const status = await db.action.get(action.id)
// { status: 'active', progress: 47, total: 100 }

// Wait for completion
const posts = await action.result()
```

## Action Status

```
pending → active → completed
                 ↘ failed → (retry) → pending
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Waiting to start |
| `active` | Currently running |
| `completed` | Finished successfully |
| `failed` | Failed (can retry) |

## Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Creating](/docs/database/actions/creating) | Start new actions |
| [Managing](/docs/database/actions/managing) | Check, retry, cancel |
| [Patterns](/docs/database/actions/patterns) | Common use cases |

## Action Features

- **Durability** - Survives process restarts
- **Progress** - Real-time progress tracking
- **Retries** - Automatic retry with backoff
- **Batching** - Group operations for efficiency
- **Queuing** - Rate limiting and concurrency control
