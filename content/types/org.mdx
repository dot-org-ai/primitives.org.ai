The `org` module provides types for organizational execution primitives.

  Database, Function, Goal, Plan, Project, Task, Workflow,
  Experiment, WorkflowExecution, ExperimentAnalysis
} from '@primitives/types/org'
```

## Types

| `Project` | Project with timeline, team, and deliverables |
| `Task` | Actionable item with status, assignee, due date |
| `Workflow` | Multi-step process with triggers and actions |
| `Experiment` | Hypothesis testing with variants and metrics |

```typescript
import type { Workflow, Task, Goal } from '@primitives/types/org'

const workflow: Workflow = {
  id: 'wf_onboard',
  name: 'Customer Onboarding',
  status: 'active',
  steps: [
    { id: 'step_1', name: 'Send welcome email', type: 'action' },
    { id: 'step_2', name: 'Schedule kickoff', type: 'action' }
