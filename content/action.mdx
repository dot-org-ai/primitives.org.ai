# Action

An Action is a [Verb](/verb) bound to specific [Things](/thing), ready to be executed.

## Overview

While a **Verb** defines an operation abstractly, an **Action** is that operation bound to specific arguments. Actions can be queued, scheduled, approved, or executed immediately.

```typescript
import { Verb, Action } from 'ai-database'

// Define a verb
const Approve = Verb('approve')

// Create an action (bound verb)
const approveInvoice = Action(Approve, {
  subject: currentUser,
  object: invoice,
})

// Execute the action
await approveInvoice.execute()
```

## Creating Actions

Actions are created by binding verbs to things:

```typescript
// From a verb
const action = Approve.bind(user, document)

// Using Action constructor
const action = Action(Approve, { subject: user, object: document })

// From natural language
const action = await Action.from('Approve invoice #1234 as admin')
```

## Action States

Actions have a lifecycle:

```typescript
action.status  // 'pending' | 'approved' | 'executing' | 'completed' | 'failed'

// Check state
action.isPending    // true if not yet executed
action.isCompleted  // true if successfully executed
action.isFailed     // true if execution failed
```

## Queuing Actions

Actions can be queued for later execution:

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'digital-tasks'

// Add to queue
await Queue.push(action)

// With delay
await Queue.push(action, { delay: '1 hour' })

// With priority
await Queue.push(action, { priority: 'high' })
```

## Approval Workflows

Actions can require approval before execution:

```typescript
import { requireApproval } from 'human-in-the-loop'

const action = Action(TransferFunds, {
  from: account1,
  to: account2,
  amount: 50000,
})

// Require human approval for large transfers
if (action.args.amount > 10000) {
  await requireApproval(action, {
    approvers: ['finance-team'],
    reason: 'Large transfer requires approval',
  })
}

await action.execute()
```

## Action Results

Executing an action returns a result and emits an [Event](/event):

```typescript
const result = await action.execute()

result.success    // boolean
result.output     // the result data
result.event      // the emitted event
result.duration   // execution time
```
