# Noun

Nouns represent the named entities and concepts in your domain - the "things" you're working with.

## Context is Everything

Every Noun exists within a [Domain](/domain) namespace - and that namespace IS the `$context`. When you define a Noun, you're not just creating a schema - you're teaching AI what this concept means in YOUR domain:

```typescript
// In the acme.do namespace/context
const Customer = Noun('Customer', {
  name: 'string',
  tier: ['free', 'pro', 'enterprise'],
})

// AI now understands what "Customer" means at acme.do
// - semantically (JSON-LD @context)
// - cognitively (how to reason about customers)
```

The same word "Customer" means different things in different domains. The namespace provides the context that disambiguates meaning for both machines and AI.

## Overview

In the primitives framework, a **Noun** is a type definition for domain entities. Nouns define the schema for [Things](/thing) - the actual instances that exist in your system.

```typescript
import { Noun } from 'ai-database'

// Define a noun (type/schema)
const Customer = Noun('Customer', {
  name: 'string',
  email: 'string',
  tier: ['free', 'pro', 'enterprise'],
})

// Create a thing (instance)
const customer = Customer.create({
  name: 'Acme Corp',
  email: 'hello@acme.com',
  tier: 'pro',
})
```

## Defining Nouns

Nouns are defined with a name and a schema:

```typescript
import { Noun } from 'ai-database'

const Invoice = Noun('Invoice', {
  number: 'string',
  amount: 'number',
  status: ['draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'overdue'],
  dueDate: 'Date',
})
```

## AI-Inferred Nouns

Nouns can be inferred from natural language:

```typescript
import { Noun } from 'ai-database'

// AI infers the schema from the description
const Product = Noun('Product', `
  A product in our catalog with a name, description,
  price, and inventory count. Products belong to categories
  and can have multiple variants.
`)
```

## Relationships

Nouns can define relationships to other nouns:

```typescript
const Order = Noun('Order', {
  number: 'string',
  customer: Customer,        // belongs to Customer
  items: [OrderItem],        // has many OrderItems
  status: ['pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered'],
})
```
