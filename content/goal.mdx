# Goal

Goals represent desired outcomes - the "why" behind work. Goals break down into [Plans](/plan), which become [Projects](/project), which contain [Tasks](/task).

## Overview

A **Goal** is a high-level objective with measurable success criteria. Goals provide direction and context for all downstream work.

```typescript
import { Goal } from 'business-as-code'

const goal = Goal('Increase customer retention', {
  metric: 'retention_rate',
  target: 0.95,        // 95% retention
  baseline: 0.82,      // Current 82%
  deadline: '2024-Q4',
})

// Track progress
goal.progress  // 0.65 (65% of the way to target)
goal.onTrack   // true/false based on trajectory
```

## Defining Goals

```typescript
import { Goal } from 'business-as-code'

const goal = Goal('Launch mobile app', {
  description: 'Ship iOS and Android apps to production',

  // Success criteria
  criteria: [
    'App approved in App Store',
    'App approved in Play Store',
    '1000+ downloads in first week',
    'Rating above 4.0 stars',
  ],

  // Timeline
  deadline: '2024-06-01',

  // Owner
  owner: 'mobile-team',
})
```

## Goal Hierarchies

Goals can have sub-goals:

```typescript
const companyGoal = Goal('Become market leader', {
  subgoals: [
    Goal('Double revenue', { target: 2_000_000 }),
    Goal('Expand to 3 new markets'),
    Goal('Achieve 50 NPS'),
  ],
})

// Progress rolls up
companyGoal.progress  // Average of subgoal progress
```

## Goals to Plans

Goals break down into actionable plans:

```typescript
import { Plan } from 'business-as-code'

const goal = Goal('Reduce churn by 20%')

const plan = Plan.for(goal, {
  strategies: [
    'Improve onboarding experience',
    'Add proactive customer success',
    'Build self-service help center',
  ],
})
```

## Tracking Progress

```typescript
// Quantitative goals
goal.current = 0.88  // Current metric value
goal.progress        // (0.88 - 0.82) / (0.95 - 0.82) = 0.46

// Criteria-based goals
await goal.complete('App approved in App Store')
goal.progress  // 0.25 (1 of 4 criteria met)

// Time-based tracking
goal.daysRemaining   // 45
goal.velocity        // Progress per day
goal.projectedDate   // When goal will be met at current velocity
```

## Goal States

```typescript
goal.status  // 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'at_risk' | 'achieved' | 'missed'

// Automatic status based on progress and timeline
goal.isAtRisk    // Behind trajectory
goal.isAchieved  // Met or exceeded target
```
