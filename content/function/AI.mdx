Create a typed AI instance with predefined schemas.

## AI Needs Context

AI is only as good as its context. When you create an `AI()` instance, you're defining schemas that exist within your [Domain](/domain) namespace - and that namespace IS the `$context`:

```typescript
// These schemas exist in YOUR domain context
const ai = AI({
  customer: {
    name: 'Customer name',
    tier: 'free | pro | enterprise',
    needs: ['List of customer needs'],
  },
})

// AI generates within YOUR context
const profile = await ai.customer('Acme Corp, enterprise SaaS')
// AI knows what "customer" means in YOUR business
```

The namespace provides the cognitive context that makes AI understand your business vocabulary, your entities, your relationships.

## Import

```typescript
import { AI } from 'ai-functions'
```

## Syntax

```typescript
const ai = AI(schemas: Record<string, Schema>)
```

## Examples

```typescript
const ai = AI({
  recipe: {
    name: 'Recipe name',
    type: 'food | drink | dessert',
    servings: 'Number of servings (number)',
    ingredients: ['List of ingredients'],
    steps: ['Cooking steps'],
  },
  blogPost: {
    title: 'Post title',
    summary: 'Brief summary',
    sections: [{
      heading: 'Section heading',
      content: 'Section content',
    }],
  },
})

// Fully typed!
const recipe = await ai.recipe('Italian pasta for 4')
// TypeScript knows: { name: string, type: 'food'|'drink'|'dessert', ... }

const post = await ai.blogPost('TypeScript tips')
// TypeScript knows: { title: string, summary: string, sections: [...] }
```

## Benefits

- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript inference
- **Reusability** - Define once, use everywhere
- **Consistency** - Same schema across calls
- **Documentation** - Schema serves as docs

## Complex Schemas

```typescript
const ai = AI({
  storyBrand: {
    hero: 'Who is the customer?',
    guide: 'Who/what helps them?',
    problem: {
      external: 'What external challenge?',
      internal: 'What internal struggle?',
      philosophical: 'Why is this wrong?',
    },
    plan: ['Steps to success'],
    callToAction: 'What should they do?',
    success: 'What does winning look like?',
    failure: 'What are they avoiding?',
  },
})

const brand = await ai.storyBrand('ai-functions library')
```
