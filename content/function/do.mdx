title: do
description: Single-pass task execution with tools
---

Single-pass task execution. Can use other ai-functions as tools, but doesn't loop like an agent.

## Import

```typescript
import { do as act } from 'ai-functions'
```

Note: `do` is a reserved word in JavaScript, import with an alias.

## Syntax

```typescript
do`task description`
do`task with ${context}`
```

## Examples

```typescript
// Simple task
const translation = await act`translate ${text} to Spanish`

// Complex task - picks appropriate tools
const analysis = await act`
  analyze this article and give me a summary,
  key people mentioned, and action items
  ${article}
`

// With context
const report = await act`
  create a competitive analysis
  ${{ competitors, ourProduct, market }}
`
```

## How It Works

`do` analyzes the task and picks appropriate tools:

```typescript
// Might internally call: summarize() + extract() + list()
const analysis = await act`
  summarize this article, extract company names,
  and list action items
  ${article}
`
```

## do vs Agent

| Feature | `do` | Full Agent |
|---------|------|------------|
| Steps | Single pass | Loops until done |
| Tools | Picks once | Re-evaluates each step |
| Complexity | Simple tasks | Complex goals |
| Speed | Fast | Slower |

Think of `do` as one step of what an agent would do.

## Use Cases

```typescript
// Data processing
const structured = await act`parse ${rawData} into JSON`

// Analysis
const report = await act`analyze ${metrics} and highlight anomalies`

// Transformation
const converted = await act`convert ${doc} to markdown`
```
