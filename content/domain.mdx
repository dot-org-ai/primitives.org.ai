# Domain

A Domain is the foundational namespace for all primitives. In this architecture, everything is URL-addressable - agents don't know file systems, they only know URLs.

## The Namespace IS the Context

Here's the key insight: **your domain namespace IS the `$context`** - and this works on two levels simultaneously:

### Semantic Context (JSON-LD)

In [mdxld](https://mdxld.org), every domain defines a JSON-LD `@context` that gives semantic meaning to your data:

```yaml
$context: https://acme.do/
$type: Customer
name: Acme Corp
```

The namespace `https://acme.do/` becomes the context that defines what "Customer", "name", and every other term means within your domain.

### AI Context (LLM)

But here's the beautiful double-entendre: in AI systems, **context is everything**. The context window is what the LLM uses to understand, reason, and respond. When you define a domain:

- You're giving the AI the **semantic context** to understand your business vocabulary
- You're providing the **cognitive context** for the AI to reason about your domain
- Every Noun, Verb, and Function you define enriches this context

```typescript
// Your domain IS the context
const acme = Domain('acme.do')

// When an AI agent operates in this domain,
// it understands what "Customer", "Invoice", "approve" mean
// because the domain provides both semantic AND cognitive context
```

**The namespace doesn't just organize your data - it teaches AI how to think about your business.**

## Overview

Every [Noun](/noun), [Verb](/verb), [Thing](/thing), [Function](/function), and [Agent](/agent) lives within a domain. Domains provide identity, discovery, and access control.

```typescript
import { Domain } from 'ai-functions'

// Define your domain
const domain = Domain('acme.do')

// Everything is URL-addressable
domain.nouns      // https://acme.do/nouns
domain.functions  // https://acme.do/functions
domain.agents     // https://acme.do/agents
domain.things     // https://acme.do/things
```

## URL-First Architecture

Agents interact with the world through URLs:

```typescript
// Agents discover capabilities via URLs
const customer = await fetch('https://acme.do/things/customer/cust_123')
const approve = await fetch('https://acme.do/verbs/approve')
const summarize = await fetch('https://acme.do/functions/summarize')

// Execute functions via HTTP
const result = await fetch('https://acme.do/functions/summarize', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ text: document }),
})
```

## Domain Configuration

```typescript
import { Domain } from 'ai-functions'

const domain = Domain('mycompany.do', {
  // Display name
  name: 'My Company',

  // Domain description for discovery
  description: 'AI-powered business automation',

  // Authentication
  auth: {
    provider: 'oauth.do',
    methods: ['api-key', 'oauth2'],
  },

  // Access control
  access: {
    public: ['functions/summarize', 'nouns/*'],
    authenticated: ['things/*', 'actions/*'],
    admin: ['agents/*', 'config/*'],
  },
})
```

## Resource URLs

Every resource has a canonical URL:

```typescript
// Nouns (type definitions)
https://acme.do/nouns/Customer
https://acme.do/nouns/Invoice

// Things (instances)
https://acme.do/things/customer/cust_123
https://acme.do/things/invoice/inv_456

// Verbs (operations)
https://acme.do/verbs/approve
https://acme.do/verbs/ship

// Functions (AI capabilities)
https://acme.do/functions/summarize
https://acme.do/functions/translate

// Agents
https://acme.do/agents/sales-assistant
https://acme.do/agents/support-bot

// Workflows
https://acme.do/workflows/onboarding
https://acme.do/workflows/order-fulfillment
```

## Discovery

Domains expose their capabilities for AI discovery:

```typescript
// Well-known discovery endpoint
const capabilities = await fetch('https://acme.do/.well-known/ai')

// Returns structured capability manifest
{
  domain: 'acme.do',
  nouns: ['Customer', 'Invoice', 'Order'],
  verbs: ['create', 'approve', 'ship', 'refund'],
  functions: ['summarize', 'classify', 'extract'],
  agents: ['sales-assistant', 'support-bot'],
}
```

## Cross-Domain References

Things can reference resources in other domains:

```typescript
const order = Thing(Order, {
  customer: 'https://crm.do/things/customer/cust_123',
  payment: 'https://payments.do/things/charge/ch_789',
  shipping: 'https://logistics.do/things/shipment/ship_456',
})
```

## Domain Federation

Domains can federate and trust each other:

```typescript
const domain = Domain('acme.do', {
  federation: {
    trusted: ['partners.do', 'suppliers.do'],
    permissions: {
      'partners.do': ['read:things', 'execute:functions'],
      'suppliers.do': ['read:nouns'],
    },
  },
})
```

## Context Propagation

When you execute a function or deploy an agent, the domain context flows through:

```typescript
// The domain context enriches every operation
const result = await domain.functions.summarize({
  text: customerFeedback,
  // The AI knows "customer" means YOUR definition of customer
  // It knows your business vocabulary, your entities, your relationships
})

// Agents inherit domain context
const agent = domain.agents.supportBot
// This agent thinks in terms of YOUR Nouns, YOUR Verbs, YOUR business rules
```

This is why domains are so powerful: they're not just organizational units or URL prefixes. They're the **shared understanding** between your data, your code, and your AI.
