Remove entities by ID.

## Import

```typescript
import { DB } from 'ai-database'

const { db } = DB({
  Post: { title: 'string' },
})
```

## Syntax

```typescript
db.Type.delete(id)
db.Type.delete(id, options)
```

## Examples

```typescript
// Delete by ID
await db.Post.delete('hello-world')

// Delete returns the deleted entity
const deleted = await db.Post.delete('hello-world')
console.log(deleted.title)  // 'Hello World'
```

## Batch Delete

```typescript
// Delete multiple
await Promise.all([
  db.Post.delete('post-1'),
  db.Post.delete('post-2'),
  db.Post.delete('post-3'),
])

// Delete by criteria
const drafts = await db.Post.find({ status: 'draft' })
await Promise.all(drafts.map(d => db.Post.delete(d.$id)))
```

## Events

Delete emits a `{Type}.deleted` event:

```typescript
await db.Post.delete('hello')
// Emits: Post.deleted { url, timestamp }
```

## Cascade Behavior

By default, relationships are nullified:

```typescript
// Post has author relationship
await db.Author.delete('alice')
// Posts by alice now have author: null
```

Configure cascade:

```typescript
await db.Author.delete('alice', {
  cascade: true,  // also delete related posts
})
```

## Soft Delete

For recoverable deletions:

```typescript
// Mark as deleted instead of removing
await db.Post.update('hello', {
  deletedAt: new Date(),
})

// Query excludes soft-deleted by default
const posts = await db.Post.list()
// doesn't include soft-deleted

// Include soft-deleted
const all = await db.Post.list({
  where: { deletedAt: { $exists: true } },
})
```

## Artifacts

When entity is deleted, artifacts are also removed:

```typescript
await db.Post.delete('hello')
// Removes: entity, embedding, all artifacts
```
