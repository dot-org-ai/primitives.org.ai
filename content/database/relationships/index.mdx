# Relationships

ai-database automatically creates bi-directional relationships from schema definitions.

## Defining Relationships

```typescript
const db = DB({
  Post: {
    title: 'string',
    author: 'Author.posts',  // one-to-many
    tags: ['Tag.posts'],     // many-to-many
  },
  Author: {
    name: 'string',
    // posts: Post[] auto-created
  },
  Tag: {
    name: 'string',
    // posts: Post[] auto-created
  },
})
```

## Relationship Syntax

| Syntax | Cardinality | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `'Type.backref'` | Many-to-one | `author: 'Author.posts'` |
| `['Type.backref']` | Many-to-many | `tags: ['Tag.posts']` |
| `'Type'` | One-way reference | `createdBy: 'User'` |

## Automatic Backrefs

When you define `author: 'Author.posts'`, the database creates:

- `Post.author` → single Author
- `Author.posts` → array of Posts

```typescript
// Forward
const post = await db.Post.get('hello')
const author = await post.author  // Author

// Backward
const author = await db.Author.get('alice')
const posts = await author.posts  // Post[]
```

## Cardinality

### One-to-Many

```typescript
// Post has one author, Author has many posts
Post: {
  author: 'Author.posts',
}
```

### Many-to-Many

```typescript
// Post has many tags, Tag has many posts
Post: {
  tags: ['Tag.posts'],
}
```

### One-to-One

```typescript
// User has one profile, Profile has one user
User: {
  profile: 'Profile.user',
}
```

## Creating with Relationships

```typescript
// Create author
const author = await db.Author.create({ name: 'Alice' })

// Create post with relationship
const post = await db.Post.create({
  title: 'Hello',
  author: author.$id,
})
```

## Querying Relationships

See [Graph Queries](/docs/database/queries/graph) for advanced relationship queries:

```typescript
// Posts by verified authors
const posts = await db.Post.find({
  $rel: {
    type: 'authored',
    from: { type: 'Author', where: { verified: true } },
  },
})
```

## Edge Records

Every relationship creates an Edge record:

```typescript
// Edge: Post.author -> Author
{
  from: 'Post',
  name: 'author',
  to: 'Author',
  backref: 'posts',
  cardinality: 'many-to-one',
}
```

Query edges for introspection:

```typescript
const edges = await db.Edge.find({ to: 'Author' })
// What types reference Author?
```
