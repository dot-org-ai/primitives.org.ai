# Build Business-as-Code & AI-Delivered Services-as-Software

Primitives for building software where humans and AI work together seamlessly.
From functions to businesses, every layer is designed for the age of AI.

## Built for the AI Era

The age of AI requires new primitives. Traditional software abstractions assume deterministic execution and human-only workflows.

- **Heterogeneous Computation** — Code, AI models, autonomous agents, and humans all participate in the same workflows with the same interfaces.
- **Uncertain Execution** — Generative and agentic functions produce variable outputs. The primitives handle retries, validation, and fallbacks transparently.
- **Distributed State** — Context flows across systems, conversations, and time horizons. Vector embeddings enable semantic understanding.
- **Collaborative Work** — AI and humans hand off tasks seamlessly. Each contributes their strengths with clear escalation paths.

## Get Started

```bash
npm install ai-functions
```

Start with [Functions](/function)—the foundation everything else builds on.
